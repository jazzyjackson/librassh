# librassh
An interactive file explorer for secure storage via ssh

Presently a speculative prototype project, but I thought I'd build something to allow me to drag and drop files into a remote server and maybe play with a GUI wrapped around ZFS's snapshot feature to reflect a versioned file system.

Something like a DIY dropbox, in the interest of making it easy to operate your own infrastructure.
Libras3 should have an identical API for S3 storage so library interfaces would work equivalently.
